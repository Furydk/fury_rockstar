## About
Hey all! This is my first resource release on the forums - it’s a fairly simple but useful script that allows you to record your in-game footage with Rockstar Editor through a clean UI (courtesy of MenuV). I noticed a lot of people in the community asking for something like this, so I decided to make it myself. It also has a logging feature which logs to a file and/or server console (configurable) whenever someone starts/deletes/saves a recording. I hope you all enjoy and find this useful!
